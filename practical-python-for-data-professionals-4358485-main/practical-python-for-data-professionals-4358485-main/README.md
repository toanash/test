As data and data-related jobs have grown over the past decade, so has the demand for data skills. If you’re a data professional, this is great news! However, it’s important to continue to adapt to the changing demands of the market, which include adopting tools like Python to approach big data challenges. In this course, Sarah Nooravi shares a practical, project-based examination of Python, covering the skills needed to help you stand out among others in a competitive market. Sarah walks through an end-to-end Python analysis, typical of what you would encounter on the job– starting from the problem statement and takes you all the way through to insight delivery. Sarah helps you break down the problem, set expectations, and covers best practices around data cleaning, data visualization and storytelling. Lastly, she also shares common pitfalls and critical business and soft skills that will help you stand out.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
